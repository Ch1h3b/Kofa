# Kofa
Lightweight Delivery App
---

Kofa is a delivery system, which does not require a user login.

Based on the python django framework, the purpose of the project is to make local deleveries easier and faster for clients by removing the need to authenticate.

Purchases are managed via cookies only.

The project was designed for a small local commune, and most will probably be inefficient in larger scales.

Running the project.

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt

### TODO
Add purchase geolocation with google maps API.
